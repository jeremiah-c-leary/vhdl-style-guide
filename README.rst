Announcements
-------------

Update 02/10/2024

For Release 3.22.0.

In an attempt to be more consistent in the configuration files, the following options are changing from camelCase to snake_case:

+---------------+--------------+
| option        |  Changed To  |
+===============+==============+
| indentSize    | indent_size  |
+---------------+--------------+
| indentStyle   | indent_style |
+---------------+--------------+

An Error message will be generated if the old style is encountered.
A reminder to change the option to snake_case will be given.

Regards,

--Jeremy

Overview
--------

VSG was created after participating in a code review where a real issue in the code was masked by a coding style issue.
A finding was created for the style issue, while the real issue was missed.
When the code was re-reviewed, the real issue was discovered.

Depending on your process, style issues can take a lot of time to resolve.

#. Create finding/ticket/issue
#. Disposition finding/ticket/issue
#. Fix
#. Verify fix

Spending less time on style issues leaves more time to analyze the substance of the code.
This ultimately reduces the amount of time performing code reviews.
It also allows reviewers to focus on the substance of the code.
This will result in a higher quality code base.

Key Benefits
------------

* Define VHDL coding standards
* Makes coding standards visible to everyone
* Improve code reviews
* Quickly bring code up to current standards

VSG allows the style of the code to be defined and enforced over part or the entire code base.
Configurations allow for multiple coding standards.

Key Features
------------

* Command line tool

  * integrate into continuous integration flow with JUnit output

* Reports and fixes issues found

  * whitespace

    * horizontal
    * vertical

  * upper and lower case
  * keyword alignments
  * etc...

* Fully configurable rules via JSON or YAML configuration file

  * Disable rules
  * Alter behavior of existing rules

* Localize rule sets

  * Create your own rules using python
  * Use existing rules as a template
  * Fully integrates into base rule set

* Built in styles

  * Use existing style or create your own

Known Limitations
-----------------

VSG is a continual work in progress.
As such, this version has the following known limitations:

* Parser will not process embedded PSL
* Parser will not process VHDL 2019

Installation
------------

You can get the latest released version of VSG via **pip**.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install vsg

The latest development version can be cloned...

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide.git

...and then installed locally...

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

VSG is a both a command line tool and a python package.
The command line tool can be invoked with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ vsg
   usage: VHDL Style Guide (VSG) [-h] [-f FILENAME [FILENAME ...]] [-lr LOCAL_RULES] [-c CONFIGURATION [CONFIGURATION ...]] [--fix]
                                 [-fp FIX_PHASE] [-j JUNIT] [-js JSON] [-of {vsg,syntastic,summary}] [-b] [-oc OUTPUT_CONFIGURATION]
                                 [-rc RULE_CONFIGURATION] [--style {indent_only,jcl}] [-v] [-ap] [--fix_only FIX_ONLY] [--stdin]
